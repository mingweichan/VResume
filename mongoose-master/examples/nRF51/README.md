# nRF51 example project

This is a Mongoose "Hello, world" that can be compiled under nRF51 IoT SDK.

To make it work, you should download [nRF51 IoT SDK](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51-IoT-SDK)
and unpack it in the current directory as `nrf51_iot_sdk`.

The project structure replicates that of the examples provided with the SDK:
Keil uVision project is located at `boards/pca10028/arm5_no_packs`, ARM-GCC
Makefile is located in `boards/pca10028/armgcc`..
