# nRF52 example project

This is a Mongoose "Hello, world" that can be compiled under nRF IoT SDK.

To make it work, you should download [nRF5 IoT SDK](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_IoT_SDK/)
and unpack it in the current directory as `nrf5_iot_sdk`.

The project structure replicates that of the examples provided with the SDK:
Keil uVision project is located at `boards/pca10040/arm5_no_packs`; ARM-GCC
Makefile is located in `boards/pca10040/armgcc`.
